MumbleDJ
========
A Mumble bot that plays music fetched from YouTube videos. There are ways to play music with a bot on Mumble already, but I wasn't really satisfied with them. Many of them require the Windows client to be opened along with other applications which is not ideal. My goal with this project is to make a Linux-friendly Mumble bot that can run on a webserver instead of a personal computer.

## Planned Features
These are features that I would like to complete before I consider the project "finished."
* Play YouTube audio through Mumble to be heard by others.
* Commands for adding/queueing YouTube audio by linking to the URL.
* Current song updates in the chat.
* Commands to play, pause, and raise/lower volume.
* Commands to allow users to move the bot from one channel to another.
* Admin commands to completely shut down the bot and perform other admin actions.
* Automatically turn on/off music when a certain number of users are inside the channel.

## Hopeful Features
These are features that would be cool to have, but might not ever make it into the bot.
* Ability to control music using voice commands instead of text commands.
* Ability to enable text-to-speech for the bot to announce the name of the next track over voice chat.
* A search command where the bot searches for a song and then plays it. Basically the add/queue command but without the URL.
* Statistics tracking.

## Setup
This section will be updated when the project is near completion.
