MumbleDJ
========
A Mumble bot that plays music fetched from YouTube videos. I have decided to experiment with rewriting the bot in Ruby using [mumble-ruby](https://github.com/perrym5/mumble-ruby). I am hoping this will cut down on the dependency list, make it easier to develop in the future, and allow for some extra functionality that wasn't previously possible.
