pymumble
=======================

In this directory you need to setup [pymumble](https://github.com/Robert904/pymumble). I chose not to directly distribute this project with mine, as a bit of setup needs to be performed anyway. Instructions on setup can be found on the pymumble README, but I will summarize here for clarity once I get the project in a somewhat finished state.
